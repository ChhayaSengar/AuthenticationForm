# Project Overview :

## Task:

<li>Handle authentication using local storage.</li>
<li>Create a UI as shown in Figma, and make 2 pages - signup and profile.
<li>On clicking signup, use local storage to create the state of the user - it should contain all the details taken in signup.
<li>The state of the user saved in localstorage should contain all the properties of the user, plus should also consist of an access token - let this access token be a random 16-byte string generated by you randomly.
<li>Once there is a state of the user in the local storage, redirect the user to a page called /profile. Display the userâ€™s details there.
<li>On clicking the logout button, set the local storage back to null and also get rid of the access token.
<li>Using scripts ensure that when a user manually tries to go to /profile, if the local storage does not contain the accesstoken the user is redirected to the signup page
<li>Similarly if the localstorage has an accesstoken and tries to go to the signup page, using scripts ensures that the user can't do so and is redirected to the profile page.
<li>Show success and errors as well as shown in the UI. All fields are mandatory for signup and similarly on successfully signing up show the message in green text and then redirect to /profile

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
